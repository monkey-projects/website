Joining an existing organization is **not available in the free tier**.  You
need a [paying subscription](pricing) to enable it.  If that is provided, you can join
an organization by clicking the "Join Organization" button in the [home screen](home).

There you can search for the organization you wish to join, either by name or
by it's unique id:
![join org img](/img/join-1.png "screenshot")

Once you have found the desired organization, you need to send a **join request**.
This will notify an administrator of the target organization, who then has to
**approve your request**.  As soon as that has happened, you will be able to select
the organization from your home screen and collaborate with other users in that
organization.
