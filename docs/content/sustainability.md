*MonkeyCI* is designed from the start to have **zero impact**.  Our goal is even
to have *negative impact* in the future.  We will do this by re-investing part
of the profits to improve our environment and to further reduce CO2 emissions.

To achieve this, we only work with infrastructure providers that work on **100%
renewable energy**.  Currently, we are using [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com)
and [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), a 100% European cloud providers that
have datacenters that fully operate on renewable energy and also attempt to
reduce footprint, e.g. regarding water consumption.  For more details, see
[the Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/environmental-leadership/)
and [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/nachhaltigkeit/) sustainability pages.
We may use services provided by other suppliers, but in any case we aim for
zero impact.  This means that at the moment of writing, we only use European
datacenters.

As cloud provides invest more in "green" datacenters, we will also have more
choices of cloud providers, or more continents to run on.  This way, we will
try to run the build jobs **as close as possible to your location**.

This means you can safely use *MonkeyCI* in your business processes and rest
assured at least we will not be contributing to global CO2 emissions!
