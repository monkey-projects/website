*MonkeyCI* is designed from the start to have **zero impact**.  Our goal is even
to have *negative impact* in the future.  We will do this by re-investing part
of the profits to improve our environment and to further reduce CO2 emissions.

To achieve this, we only work with infrastructure providers that work on 100%
renewable energy.  Currently, we are using Oracle Cloud, and only those
datacenters that fully operate on renewable energy.  For more details, see
[their data sheet](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/citizenship/clean-cloud-oci.pdf).
This means that at the moment of writing, we only use European datacenters.

As cloud provides invest more in "green" datacenters, we will also have more
choices of cloud providers, or more continents to run on.  This way, we will
try to run the build jobs as close as possible to your location.

This means you can safely use *MonkeyCI* in your business processes and rest
assured at least we will not be contributing to global CO2 emissions!
