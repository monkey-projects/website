*MonkeyCI* tries to support the most popular platforms, and we plan to add more.
Currently we support these `git` repository hosts:

 - [Github](https://github.com)
 - [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)

In the short term, we are also planning to add support for [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)
and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
