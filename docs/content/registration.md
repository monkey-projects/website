Registering as a new user is easy: simply login using one of the provided
authentication methods.  Currently, this means either using [GitHub](https://github.com)
or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).  In the future, we will expand this to more
authentication methods.  A new user account will be automatically created.  Users
can be linked to [customers](customer/) and each non-paying user can [create
at most one free customer](customer-new/).  From then on, this customer will
be used as the default.  You can also [request access to other customers](customer-join/).

As soon as you have created or joined a customer, you can start [watching builds](watch/),
configure [build parameters](params/) or [ssh keys](ssh-keys/).
