Joining an existing organization is free, but accepting other users in your organization
is **not available in the free tier**.  You need a [paying subscription](pricing) to
enable it.  You can join an organization by clicking the "Join Organization" button
in the [home screen](home).

There you can search for the organization you wish to join, either by name or
by it's unique id:
![join org img](/img/join-1.png "screenshot")

Once you have found the desired organization, you need to send a **join request**.
This will notify an administrator of the target organization, who then has to
**approve your request**.  As soon as that has happened, you will be able to select
the organization from your home screen and collaborate with other users in that
organization.

## Accepting Users

If enabled, and you are an organization administrator, then you can accept
(or decline) join requests.  If you decline, you can also pass a message to
the requesting user for more feedback.  When a user has joined the organization,
(s)he can view all repositories configured on the organization.
