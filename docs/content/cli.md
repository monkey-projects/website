Next to a graphical user interface, *MonkeyCI* also provides a command-line
interface (or **CLI**).  The CLI can be used to trigger builds, run them locally,
verify build scripts or run unit tests.

## Installation

In order to install the CLI, you will first need to [install Java](https://www.oracle.com/javadownload).  You'll need **Java 21 or later** for the CLI to work correctly.  Then run this script:

```shell
$ wget https://monkeyci-artifacts.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/install-cli.sh -O - | bash
```

It will download the *MonkeyCI* `jar` file, put it in a local directory and
create a binary that allows you to invoke it.  The binary is installed in `$HOME/bin`,
which usually is in your `PATH`.  If it doesn't work, check if the bin dir has been
added to your path.

## Invocation

Running the CLI is done by invoking the `monkeyci` command:

```shell
$ monkeyci build --help

NAME:
  build - Build commands

USAGE:
  build [global-options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
 0.19.10

COMMANDS:
   run                  Runs build locally
   verify               Verifies local build script
   test                 Runs build script unit tests

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   -?, --help
```

Although there are other commands, they are intended for internal use and so only
the `build` command will be discussed here.

### Running Builds Locally

Runs a build locally.  It will load the build script, and execute any jobs according
to the configuration.  For container jobs, [podman](https://podman.io) is used.  Note
that local builds do not count towards your credit consumption, and it will also not
register on the main application.  **Artifacts and caches are not downloaded or
published**.

This can be useful to run a one-of, or to try something out.  For actual testing it's better
to write [unit tests](tests).  Below are the possible options you can pass to the command:

```shell
NAME:
  build run - Runs build locally

USAGE:
  build run [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   -d, --dir S          .monkeyci  Script location
   -u, --git-url S                 Git repository url
   -b, --branch S                  Repository branch
   -t, --tag S                     Repository tag
       --commit-id S               Commit id
       --sid S                     Repository sid
   -p, --param S                   Build param
       --params-file S             Build params file
   -?, --help
```

Normally, you will navigate to your git repository directory.  There you will run
the build command:
```bash
$ monkeyci build run
```

This will execute the build script found in the local `.monkeyci/` directory.  If you
want to override this, you can use the `-d` switch.  It's also possible to execute a
build directory from a git repository, by passing in the `--git-url`.  If you want to
use a private repository, make sure your SSH-keys are configure correctly (in the `~/.ssh`
directory).

#### Parameters

By default, when running a local build, no parameters will be passed.  In the future,
we will add the possibility to fetch [parameters](params) from the global API, but this
feature is still under development.  You can, however, explicitly specify build parameters
on the command line.  Either by specifying them literally using the `-p` or `--param`
option, or by putting them all in a file, and passing its path using the `--params-file`
option.  Each of these support multiple occurrances.  For example:

```bash
$ monkeyci build test -p PARAM1=value1 -p PARAM2=VALUE2
```

Or, using a file:
```bash
$ monkeyci build test -p PARAM1=value1 --params-file params.edn
```

The `--params-file` option accepts `edn`, `json`, `yaml` or Java Properties files.
A `json` parameters file could look like this:

```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "highly-secret-value"
}
```

These parameters are then passed to your build script, where they can be retrieved
using the [build-params](https://cljdoc.org/d/com.monkeyci/app/0.19.7.1/api/monkey.ci.api#build-params) api function.

```clojure
(ns build
  (:require [monkey.ci.api :as m]))

(m/action-job
 "show-param"
 (fn [ctx]
   ;; Will print the username value to the job output
   (println "The username is:" (get (m/build-params ctx) "username"))))
```

### Verifying Build Scripts

When you want to do a quick verification of your build script syntax, the `build verify`
command is ideal.  It does not run any jobs or tests, but it does a static code analysis
of the build script itself, and will flag any syntax errors or warnings.

```shell
$ monkeyci build verify

Build script is valid!
```

It will either print out a success message, or list any errors and warnings it encounters.

### Running Unit Tests

Runs any unit tests that you may have configured on your build script.  See [unit
tests](tests/) for more details.

## Configuration

Not everything is configurable via command line arguments.  Some more uncommon
settings can be set via the configuration files.  These are [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn)
files that are read at application startup.  There is a global file located
at `/etc/monkeyci/config.edn` and a user-specific file in `$HOME/.config/monkeyci/config.edn`.
In addition, you can pass extra configuration files using the `-c` command line
argument:

```shell
monkeyci -c /path/to/config.edn build run
```

You can specify multiple configuration files this way.

The files are read in this order:

  1. First the global file
  2. Then the user-specific file
  3. Then the files from the command line, in order.

This means that the global file has the lowest priority, settings can be
overridden in the user file or those on the command line.

### Configuration File Structure

The configuration file is hierarchical, so it's a tree of maps, where
settings are grouped according to module.

**Podman Settings**

Podman is used to run local container.  Its settings reside in the `:podman`
key.  These are the possible parameters:

|Parameter|Meaning|Default|
|---|---|---|
|`:podman-cmd`|The path to the podman executable|`/usr/bin/podman`|

For example:
```clojure
{:podman
 {:podman-cmd "/usr/local/bin/podman"}}
```
